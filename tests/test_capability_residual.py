"""KM5 §4.2 lazy capability-residual activation (DEFAULT OFF).

A planted capability-divergent learner (strong retrieval, weak method_selection
on ONE shared facet) drives real attempts. With the feature enabled the
projection activates a learner-specific residual per diverging (facet,
capability): the capability-sliced residual belief tracks the planted truth
better than the pooled shared parent, without inflating that parent. Activation
is derived in the projection fold, so a rebuild reproduces it byte-identically.
