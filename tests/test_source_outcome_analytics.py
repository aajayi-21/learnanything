"""ING M8 — provenance-outcome analytics + source_exposure contexts (§11, §9.2).

Report-only associations gated on min samples with visible uncertainty; the new
exposure contexts (tutor_citation, provenance_panel, conflict_review) record; and
the actionable associations flow into the maintenance feed additively.
