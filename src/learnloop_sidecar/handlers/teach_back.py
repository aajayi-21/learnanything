"""Teach-back conversation RPCs: start, submit turn, finish (grade transcript).

The learner teaches the practice item's concept to an AI naive student. The
conversation state (core ``TeachBackState``) is persisted verbatim inside the
session checkpoint's ``current_answer`` slot as ``{"mode": "teach_back",
"state": <state dict>}``, so a crash mid-conversation is resumable and no new
tables are needed. The finishing turn grades the whole transcript as ONE
``teach_back`` attempt and clears the checkpoint in the same call (mirroring
``submit_attempt``'s lost-response guarantee).
