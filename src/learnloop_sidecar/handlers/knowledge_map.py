    Pipeline: one L2-normalized vector per item over the facet vocabulary

    ``predicted_correctness``), a blended distance matrix
    (0.6 x cosine facet distance + 0.4 x normalized concept-graph geodesic,
    same-LO pairs forced to 0 in the graph term), then classical MDS
    (Torgerson double-centering + top-2 eigenvectors via cyclic Jacobi —
    pure python, numpy is not a project dependency and the matrices are tiny).

    Determinism: items are processed in sorted-id order, Jacobi sweeps are
    cyclic (fixed pivot order), eigenpairs are stably sorted by descending
    eigenvalue, and each eigenvector's sign is fixed by forcing its
    largest-|component| entry (first index on ties) positive. Two calls on the
    same vault state therefore return byte-identical coordinates.

    ``stress`` is Kruskal stress-1 between the blended input distances and the
    embedded 2D distances — an honesty number: the plane is an approximation,
    and this is how approximate.

    The ``facet_field`` companion object carries the facet-native dual field;
    each of its ``points`` also carries lock state for the padlock UI:
    ``locked`` and the distinct ``lock_sources`` driving it, computed via a
    single ``identity_locks`` closure pass (§3.4).
