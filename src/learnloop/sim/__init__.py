"""Synthetic-student simulation harness for the LearnLoop belief pipeline.

Generates attempts from parameterized synthetic students *through the real
pipeline* (``build_due_queue`` -> ``apply_attempt`` -> follow-up gate) so the
team can test identifiability of planted misconceptions, measure
belief-vs-truth accuracy, and discover which config parameters actually change
scheduling decisions before spending scarce real-learner data on them.
