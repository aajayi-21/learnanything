"""Learner-initiated calibration sessions (spec_probe_eig_redesign.md §5.9).

A calibration session is an explicit wrapper (goal wizard, command palette)
that batches multiple diagnostic-episode blocks across a goal's facet scope in
one sitting, ordered adaptively by cross-LO predictive information rate, with
its own time budget, progress display, and stop control. It is belief-feeding
and adaptive — the opposite of a held-out exam — and reuses the same episode,
presentation, and observation machinery and integrity rules; it lifts only the
per-session qualifying-observation cap within its declared budget.
