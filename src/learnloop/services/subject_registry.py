"""Registry review (spec_source_ingestion_v2 §5.7; spec_knowledge_model §3.4, §12.2).

The facet-contract registry for one subject, as review cards: claim, kind,
conditions, examples, non-goals, error signatures, repairs, a status chip, and
the lock state that decides whether pre-lock merge/coarsen actions are offered.
Plus the identifiability warnings raised at synthesis (``coarsen_distinction`` /
``generate_discriminator`` generation-needs).

Pre-lock actions are legal-with-review (§3.4): ``propose_facet_merge`` creates a
review proposal item through the existing proposal machinery — it NEVER
auto-merges. Coarsening accepts an existing ``coarsen_distinction`` review item
by proposing the merge of its confusable pair and resolving the need.
