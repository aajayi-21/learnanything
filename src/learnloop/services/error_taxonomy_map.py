"""Stable mechanism taxonomy and the single legacy → canonical error-type map.

Knowledge-model spec §10.1 defines a nine-value *mechanism* taxonomy that routes
repair and diagnosis. It is a **grader contract**: the grader emits these values
under ``mvp-0.7`` (``GRADING_PROMPT_VERSION`` is bumped with it); legacy vaults
keep the old vocabulary and replay frozen. ``map_legacy_error_type`` is the ONE
place that resolves any legacy error-type name (the §10.1 legacy names, the
actual mvp-0.6 grader vocabulary, and the config ``[error_impacts]`` keys) onto
the canonical nine, so consumers can reason in a single space. It is the identity
on the canonical values and a pass-through for unknown vault-specific ids.

§10.1 legacy mapping (verbatim):
  recall_failure          -> retrieval_failure
  conceptual_error        -> conceptual_schema_error
  procedure_error         -> procedure_execution_error
  notation_error          -> representation_notation_error
  assumption_error        -> condition_assumption_error
  theorem_selection_error -> selection_planning_error
  transfer_failure        -> transfer_context_error

Reviewed decisions for the two legacy names §10.1 leaves open (they are consumed
in config ``[error_impacts]`` / the deterministic don't-know path):

* ``arithmetic_slip -> local_slip`` — the new taxonomy renames the "local slip"
  mechanism; arithmetic_slip is exactly a local, non-conceptual execution error
  (config: severity 0.15, ``families = {numeric}``, ``is_misconception`` False).
  A direct 1:1.
* ``scaffold_failure -> retrieval_failure`` — scaffold_failure is "could not
  reconstruct after hints": mechanistically a retrieval lapse (seed tags
  ``[recall, scaffold]``, ``families = {recall}``, ``is_misconception`` False),
  differing from recall_failure only in *severity* (failed despite support). The
  mechanism taxonomy routes repair/diagnosis and both route to
  retrieval/spacing; the severity distinction is preserved by the severity
  machinery (``local_severity_gain``, the hinted-don't-know severity example),
  not by the mechanism label. Conservative: it never upgrades a support-assisted
  failure into a conceptual/procedural belief error, and it invents no scaffold
  mechanism absent from the nine.

The mvp-0.6 grader vocabulary (``conceptual_slip``, ``procedure_misapplication``,
``incomplete_answer``) is a set of synonyms for the §10.1 legacy names; each maps
to the same canonical mechanism so a taxonomy regrade-check comparing mechanisms
across a prompt-version bump shows no attribution regression.
