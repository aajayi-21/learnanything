"""Review-log reconstruction for FSRS fitting.

The live path derives FSRS ratings and elapsed intervals on the fly and never
freezes them per attempt, so a fitting job re-derives them from the raw
``practice_attempts`` stream using the exact live semantics
(``fsrs_rating_for_attempt`` = score binning + hint cap; elapsed = gap between
successive persisted attempts on the item, matching ``_elapsed_days`` reading
``practice_item_state.last_attempt_at``).
