"""Exam-readiness-by-task-family report (source-ingestion §15).

    declared blueprint distribution (exam profiles + blueprint weights)
      ×  facet-capability state (KM2 certification ledger + a KM §9.2 projection)
      per task family,
    with exam-calibration Brier overlays where practice-exam data exists.

The display rule (KM §9.6) is honoured: every row is labelled with a clear
Ready-vs-Demonstrated split — Ready is the projected success probability (predicted
performance), Demonstrated is the certification-ledger credit (evidence actually
banked). We never blend them into one number.

**ING M8 — fully calibrated.** On top of the M7 lightweight table this computes,
Monte-Carlo-free, a predicted SCORE DISTRIBUTION per blueprint family: modelling a
family as ``n`` independent Bernoulli tasks with success probability ``p`` gives an
analytic mean ``p`` and variance ``p(1-p)/n``; the whole-exam predicted score is the
weight-normalized aggregate ``S = Σ wᵢ·pᵢ`` with ``Var(S) = Σ wᵢ²·pᵢ(1-pᵢ)/nᵢ``. That
predicted distribution is overlaid — clearly labelled, never blended — with the
practice-exam Brier calibration from ``exam_calibration.py`` when data exists, so the
learner sees predicted-vs-demonstrated AND how well past predictions held up. Both
the LIGHTWEIGHT M7 table and the M8 distribution are deterministic and add zero
provider tokens (KM §12.9).
