"""Unresolved-cause-set probe targeting (knowledge-model §11.1).

Implements the §11.1 probe/episode priority order over the task graph, capability
ledger, and observation provenance, so a diagnostic targets what actually needs
discriminating instead of re-establishing settled facts. Priority (rough order):

1. an unresolved failure **cause set** whose candidates imply different repairs
   (distinct facets) -> select an instrument that DISCRIMINATES the candidate
   causes (KM4 contrast bindings / compositional records);
2. capability-direct-vs-prior disagreement -> stays SHADOW (§11.1 item 2;
   `episode_priority_disagreement` earns live authority only on held-out data);
3. the least-certain **bottleneck** requirement shared across at-risk blueprints;
4. the **integration condition** — components strong AND direct integrated
   performance weak -> probe coordination/selection, NOT the components again;
5. **transfer** to a new independent surface family.

Plus the suppression rule: if strong downstream `embedded` evidence already
demonstrates a prerequisite facet, early probes MUST NOT re-establish it.

This is the diagnostic instrument-choice path (already "diagnostic", not routine
scheduling); it is conservative and leaves the live EIG ranking untouched except
to prefer a discriminating instrument when an episode targets a cause set.
