"""Facet evidence timeline — the Demonstrated curve (KM §9.6 phase 1, §16).

A deterministic, replayable fold over the immutable observation ledger,
*including* grading supersessions, retired observations and corrected
attribution, producing a **non-monotone** Demonstrated curve for one canonical
facet. A regrade that retires/replaces an observation renders as a visible
annotated correction event — the curve may step down — rather than being
smoothed away.

The fold is a pure function (:func:`fold_demonstrated_timeline`): recomputing the
series from scratch is byte-identical to rendering it incrementally (§16), which
its unit test asserts directly. No snapshot tables, no replay — the sidecar
extracts observation events from the persisted rows and folds them.

Design notes (deliberate phase-1 simplifications, documented):

* The plotted quantity is cumulative **certification credit** for the facet: the
  direct, unassisted, capability-matched positive pseudo-mass accrued so far —
  the same primitive the KM2 canonical projection banks (``certification_credit``
  over ``allocate_success_mass``). Assisted attempts earn zero credit (§5.4), so
  a hinted attempt is a flat point, not a rise.
* Independence, correlation-group budgets, and the attempt-wide ceiling use the
  same shared contribution calculator as the canonical projection. The final
  timeline value therefore equals the banked ledger credit exactly.
* Each graded attempt contributes exactly its *latest grading epoch*'s credit.
  A regrade replaces the attempt's previous contribution (not adds to it), so the
  running total is always ``Σ latest-epoch-credit`` — the "as-of" invariant that
  makes from-scratch == incremental.
