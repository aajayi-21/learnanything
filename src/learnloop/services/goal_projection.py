"""Forward projection of facet recall against a goal's due date.

Goals commit to a ``target_recall`` over a facet set by a ``due_at`` (or, for
open-ended goals, the default projection horizon). Deciding whether a facet is
*on track* requires projecting its recall forward to that horizon.

Facet recall states are beta distributions with **no time decay** (the mean is
evidence, not a memory trace). The forgetting information lives on FSRS per
*practice item* (``stability`` + ``last_attempt_at``). So a facet-level forward
projection must be derived from the FSRS states of the items that carry
evidence for that facet.

MVP approximation (documented deliberately, so a later model can replace it):

  * ``current_recall`` is the aggregate facet recall mean.
  * For each active supporting item (an active practice item whose evidence
    weight for the facet is > 0) that has an FSRS ``stability`` and a parseable
    ``last_attempt_at``, we form a *retention ratio* — the FSRS forgetting
    curve at the horizon divided by the curve at ``now`` — and take the
    evidence-weighted mean across items. ``projected_recall`` is
    ``current_recall`` scaled by that mean.
  * When no supporting item carries decay information, ``projected_recall`` is
    just ``current_recall``. This is *no decay information*, which is not the
    same as *no decay* — we simply cannot do better without an FSRS state, so we
    hold recall flat rather than inventing a curve.
  * When there is no aggregate recall state at all, both ``current_recall`` and
    ``projected_recall`` are ``None``.
