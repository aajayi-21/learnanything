"""Exam seeding: import a past practice exam's per-question outcomes.

Two halves:

1. ``exam_ingest_instructions`` builds the exam-specific canonical-ingestor
   instructions used by ``learnloop ingest-exam`` (a thin wrapper over
   ``ingest_canonical_source``): one practice item per exam question, tagged
   ``exam_q:<n>`` + ``exam_question``.
2. ``seed_exam_attempts`` turns a learner-supplied outcomes file into
   backdated, discounted ``exam_evidence`` attempts through the normal
   deterministic belief pipeline (``apply_attempt`` with a ``FrozenClock``),
   then replays the affected learning objects so FSRS/mastery are recomputed
   in ``created_at`` order.

Design notes:

- Grading path: ``complete_self_graded_attempt`` maps learner confidence 1-5
  onto grader_confidence {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0}, which cannot represent the
  configured ``exam_seeding.grader_confidence`` (default 0.7). Seeding
  therefore synthesizes a ``ResolvedGrade`` directly and calls
  ``apply_attempt`` — the same shared step used by live recording and replay.
  No ``attempt_feedback_metadata`` row is written (that table's
  ``grading_source`` CHECK only knows codex|ai|self and the row is a
  presentation concern, not part of the belief pipeline).
- Rounding: each rubric criterion is awarded ``score * criterion.points``
  rounded to 2 decimals, so total/max matches the reported score fraction to
  within 0.005 per criterion. The integer ``rubric_score`` then follows the
  standard ``int(round(sum))`` rule shared with self-grading, so LO-level
  correctness is quantized to the rubric scale while facet evidence keeps the
  exact fraction.
- Idempotency key: (practice item, exam date) — an item is skipped when it
  already has an ``exam_evidence`` attempt whose ``created_at`` date equals
  the exam date.
- Timestamps: seeded attempts are stamped at 12:00:00 UTC on the exam date
  plus ``index`` seconds in ascending question order, so created_at ordering
  is stable and deterministic across runs.
