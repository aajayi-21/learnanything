"""Capability grid — facet × capability heatmap for an LO neighborhood (KM §9.6).

Each cell encodes the dual axis for a (facet, capability) pair:

* **Demonstrated** — capability-matched direct/embedded certification credit
  (``facet_capability_evidence.certification_credit > 0``); the honest answer to
  "certified for retrieval but never tested on selection".
* **Ready** — the pooled expected-performance prediction over the shared facet
  mean (capability-agnostic at launch, §4.2, so the same Ready value tiles a
  facet's row; certification is the axis that discriminates capabilities).
* **untested** — no direct evidence has touched this capability cell at all.

It supersedes the per-LO facet radar as the diagnostic drill-down (the radar
stays for legacy mvp-0.6 vaults, which have no capability ledger). Pure read over
the persisted capability ledger + shared facet state; writes nothing.
